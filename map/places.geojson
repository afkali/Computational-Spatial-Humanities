In 1995, the doorway was moved to the James Joyce Centre, a museum in an elegant Georgian house at 35 North Great George's Street. Very recently the door was reunited with its knocker, which a New Yorker named Fredric Seiden, visiting Dublin and making a pilgrimage to 7 Eccles, removed when he realized that the house was soon to be torn down. The James Joyce Centre flew Seiden from New York to Dublin in June 2013 to return the loud proud knocker to its place of honor.",

Egging raw youths on to get in the know all the time drawing secret service pay from the castle. Drop him like a hot potato. Why those plainclothes men are always courting slaveys. Easily twig a man used to uniform. Squarepushing up against a backdoor. Maul her a bit. Then the next thing on the menu. And who is the gentleman does be visiting there? Was the young master saying anything?' In Cyclops Martin Cunningham suggests that some state surveillance has been conducted on Bloom: 'He’s a perverted jew, says Martin, from a place in Hungary and it was he drew up all the plans according to the Hungarian system.

The paper regressed to more pro-British views from 1784 to 1802 under the editorship of Francis Higgins, the 'Sham Squire,' but it regained its moral footing in the 19th century, especially under the ownership of Sir John Gray from the 1840s to the early 70s, when it advocated for land reform, disestablishment of the Church of Ireland, and Catholic civil rights. Gray's son, Edmund Dwyer Gray, took over management of the paper in 1875 and involved it in the nationalist campaign for Home Rule, which made it hated and feared in England.Ambivalent attitudes toward Charles Stewart Parnell that originated with John Gray kept the paper loyal to the great Irish parliamentary leader in the immediate aftermath of the O'Shea divorce scandal that tore apart his party, but finally caused it to renounce him in September 1891. In March 1892 the Freeman merged with a paper called the National Press, resulting in the full name used twice in Ulysses, the 'Freeman's Journal and National Press'",

This nationalist publication (a designation more deserved at some times than at others) was Ireland's first truly national paper during the 19th century, and in 1904 its circulation was so large that it could claim, in weekly ads, to be 'the leading Irish newspaper.' Leopold Bloom works for the paper lining up ads—in Lestrygonians Nosey Flynn tells Davy Byrne that 'He does canvassing for the Freeman'—and from Lotus Eaters to Sirens Bloom carries around a copy of the June 16 issue. Having thought in Calypso about his paper's logo of a homerule sun rising up in the northwest, Bloom walks around with a copy of the day's Freeman throughout Lotus Eaters. He carries it in a sidepocket of his jacket, rolls it up lengthwise into a 'baton' and taps his leg with it, sticks it in his armpit, unfolds it to look at ads, and uses it to shield Martha Clifford's letter from view.",

All the traffic from people catching trams to various parts of the city, or coming to enter the momument, made the pillar's base a natural spot for sellers to hawk flowers and food. As Paddy Dignam's funeral procession passes by the pillar in Hades, a girl is selling plums to tourists and locals coming to take in the view: '—Eight plums a penny! Eight for a penny!' Stephen takes these calls as the inspiration for his narrative vignette in the next chapter. His two elderly vestals, Florence MacCabe and Anne Kearns, 'want to see the views of Dublin from the top of Nelson's pillar.' They buy bread and pressed meat, plus 'four and twenty ripe plums from a girl at the foot of Nelson's pillar,' pay threepence each for admission to the staircase, and 'begin to waddle slowly up the winding staircase,' exclaiming wearily at the distance and 'peeping at the airslits.'",

The erection of the monument moved many Dubliners to give a new name to the street, and members of the Dublin Corporation tried to make the change official in the 1880s. Other residents objected, however, and the Corporation did not obtain legal authority to make the change until 1890. Faced with continuing opposition, it decided to give the new name time to become popular with the citizenry.",

Soon afterward it was extended to the river as part of a grand thoroughfare leading to the centers of government power, with the section north of the pillar called Upper Sackville Street and the southern section called Lower. But Joyce's novel only uses the name of the Duke of Dorset once, when Bloom thinks in Ithaca of buying lily-of-the-valley bulbs from a seed and bulb business at '23 Sackville street, upper.' Although the name O'Connell Street did not become official until 1924, after Irish independence, the language of Ulysses suggests that this process was far advanced by 1904. Passages in Lotus Eaters, Aeolus, Wandering Rocks, and Ithaca use the new name, not Sackville. After passing the Sir Philip Crampton memorial and the William Smith O'Brien statue on the south side of the river, the funeral procession in Hades crosses the O'Connell Bridge and begins its journey up O'Connell Street by passing 'under the hugecloaked Liberator's form.' O'Connell was known as the Liberator or Emancipator for his herculean efforts to enfranchise Ireland's Catholics and return the Irish Parliament to Dublin. As the cortège passes up the boulevard, the narrative calls attention to some of its prominent features, including statues erected in memory of Sir John Gray, Lord Nelson, and Father Thomas Mathew.",

During the 1916 Eastern Rising Irish troops from the barracks were involved. 1922 the Irish troops took control of the barracks, and it became their headquarters.
